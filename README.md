# LoopDown

LoopDown is a tiny bookmarklet (javascript code snippet), that allows you download loops from [Looperman.com](http://looperman.com/loops) without being logged in.

To use it grap everything from `LoopDown.js` except the first line. The type `javascript:` into the url bar of your browser and paste the copied content. The script will only work while you are on [Looperman.com](http://looperman.com/loops) browsing loops.

You can create a bookmarklet to save the time for copying the script and have it at hand with only one click. But be sure to check back every now and then in case the script changes!
